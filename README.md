# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to look at how the type of city impacts total fares and average fares per ride and average fares per driver. This data would be extremely helpful for anyone who is determining the best locations to launch a new ride-sharing company, such as PyBer.

## Results
The first output was a table that depicted Total Rides, Total Drivers, TOtal Fares, Average Fare Per Ride, and Average Fare Per Driver. Urban environments had a larger total fare, however, average fare per ride and per driver were higher for rural and suburban commmunities. This intuitiely makes sense as there are more total drivers and rides needed in larger environments. In turn, it makes sense that average fare rides are higher in rural areas where drivers might be making longer drives.

The second output was to create a line chart of the data per month. This analysis is also interesting to note as it was looking at the data based off of MoM performance. All three city types saw a peak in ridership at the end of February. This could be due to weather patterns during the end of February making people less inclined to want to drive themselves.

## Summary
Three action items for PyBer are the following:

1. Ensure that you hire enough drivers in large Urban environments. Urban environments tend to need more drivers than suburban or rural environments.
2. Although the overall number of rides in rural and suburban communities are less than urban communities, it is still profitable to have a presence in both types of communities.
3. There appears to be seasonality, specifically in Urban and Suburban environments, in total fares during the winter months of January and February. Ensuring that we have a large presence of drivers during this time period will allow us to capitalize on the seasonality of ride sharing apps.
